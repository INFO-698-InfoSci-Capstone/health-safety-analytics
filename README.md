## Overview
Mining is a high-risk industry, yet most safety systems are reactive, responding only after accidents occur. However, job descriptions and site records hold valuable insights that could help prevent injuries. We propose ***MineGuard*** — a proactive system that leverages textual mining job descriptions to predict potential injury body parts and generate safety recommendations, aiming to enhance prevention and improve worker safety awareness.
